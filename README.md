Welcome to **HBnB Evolution**, a modern, scalable, and feature-rich vacation rental application inspired by Airbnb. This project aims to build a robust platform from the ground up, focusing on a clean architecture and a great user experience.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the HBnB Evolution application. The project is divided into several parts, starting with comprehensive technical documentation and evolving into a fully functional application.

### Context and Objective

The initial phase of this project focuses on creating detailed technical documentation. This documentation will serve as the blueprint for the entire development process, ensuring a clear understanding of the system's architecture, business logic, and component interactions.

### Problem Description

We are building a simplified version of an Airbnb-like application named **HBnB Evolution**. The platform will enable users to perform the following core operations:

-   **üë§ User Management:**
    -   Register and manage user profiles.
    -   Differentiate between regular users and administrators.

-   **üè† Place Management:**
    -   List and manage properties (places) with details like name, description, price, and location.
    -   Associate amenities with each place.

-   **‚≠ê Review Management:**
    -   Leave reviews and ratings for visited places.

-   **‚ú® Amenity Management:**
    -   Manage the amenities available for places.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack (Planned)

-   **Backend:** Python (Flask/FastAPI)
-   **Frontend:** (To be determined - e.g., React, Vue)
-   **Database:** (To be determined - e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
-   **Deployment:** (To be determined - e.g., Docker, AWS)

## üìö Documentation

The complete technical documentation, including UML diagrams (Package, Class, Sequence), will be developed as the first part of this project. This will ensure a solid foundation for implementation.
